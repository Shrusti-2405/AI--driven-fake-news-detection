    <h2>About Factify</h2>
    <p>
        This project, Factify, is a powerful demonstration of modern AI capabilities applied to the critical task of fake news detection and fact-checking. It was developed by K. Anantha Krishna Rao as part of an ongoing journey in AIML learning.
    </p>
    <p>
        The system leverages a locally-run Large Language Model (<strong>google/flan-t5-base</strong>) to analyze claims. When a user submits a statement, the application performs real-time Google searches using the SerpApi to gather current evidence from the web. This evidence is then passed to the AI model, which provides a reasoned analysis of the claim's validity.
    </p>
    <p>
        This entire application, from the Python backend with Flask to the interactive front-end, showcases a complete end-to-end AI product development cycle.
